The vibe.d load-balancer and virtual host manager

**NOTE: This project is not yet in a functional state and development is currently suspended.** Development is expected to be resumed somewhere in 2017. Until then, any generic load balancing solution, such as the one [integrated into Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html) can be used as a manually configured replacement.
